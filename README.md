### Quick Start

**NOTE: These instructions will be updated with a greatly simplified installation process soon**

To get started with Crestify, try out our Vagrant image!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/crestify/crestify.git && cd crestify
$ pip install fabric
$ fab vagrant_init
```

*side note: In order to install Fabric, you might need to install the `libffi-dev` & `libssl-dev` packages on Ubuntu.*

That's it! Open your browser, head to `http://localhost:4545`, create an account, and you'll be good to go!

To get the latest updates to Crestify, run:

```bash
fab update
```

And the latest updates from the master branch will be applied.

For manual install, see `INSTALL.md`.

### Tech Stack

Crestify is built on the Flask framework and written in Python 3.

* Languages: Python 3 & Javascript (Extensions)
* Framework: Flask
* Database: Crestify uses PostgreSQL as its database, and takes advantage of the full-text search capabilities of Postgres. Redis is used as a temp database for holding incoming tab saves
* Message Queue: Redis is used as a message queue for asynchronously-run tasks related to bookmarking
* Browser: Crestify uses Puppeteer to generate the DOM like a browser does for full-text extraction and readability view generation
